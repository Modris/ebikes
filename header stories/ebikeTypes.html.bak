	<h1> Spreading Awareness </h1>
	<p> The goal of this website was to spread the knowledge about how ebikes will change the future, how it touched my life and how it may touch your life in the upcoming future. If you want more information about ebike types, buying turnkey vs DIY then please visit <a href="https://ebikes.ca/getting-started.html"> ebikes.ca/getting-started.html </a> for more information.
	</p>
	<p> Ebikes.ca is a website that focuses on the technical aspects of e-bikes. It offers a variety of resources for e-bike enthusiasts, including articles, videos, and forums. One of the main topics covered on the website is the difference between hub motor and mid-drive motor e-bikes. Hub motor e-bikes have the motor located in the wheel hub, while mid-drive motor e-bikes have the motor located in the bike's crankset. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, and ebikes.ca provides detailed information on both types to help users make an informed decision.

	<h1> My Choice </h1>
	<p> One of the main reasons I chose to build my own e-bike rather than buying one was because it was my main commute vehicle. I couldn't afford to wait for warranty parts if something were to go wrong with a pre-built e-bike. By building my own e-bike, I knew exactly what components were being used and could easily fix any issues that arose.
	</p>
	<p> Another factor to consider when deciding whether to buy or build an e-bike is cost. While building an e-bike can be more expensive upfront, it can also be more cost-effective in the long run. I was able to customize my e-bike to my specific needs and preferences, which meant that I didn't have to spend money on unnecessary features. Plus, I saved money on labor costs by doing the work myself.
	This snippet from ebikes.ca information about warranty parts and company coverage helped cement my decision. </p> 
	<p> "When purchasing ready to ride ebikes, the long term support can be very tenuous. Many shops that retail ebikes have little technical knowledge of how the system works or how to service components. Instead, they are dependent on the manufacturer to supply replacement parts and look after warranty work. In the first few years after purchase this service model generally works fine, but it starts to break down beyond the five year mark.</p>
	<p> Does the shop that sold the bike still exist? Does the manufacturer still make compatible replacement parts for that particular model? Does the manufacturer even still exist? We've been in this industry long enough to see countless ebike companies come and go, with only a few lasting more than five years, and fewer still surviving to the ten year mark. Even those companies that were thought to be well backed and financed can suddenly disappear leaving tens of thousands of customers with an unsupported proprietary system. "
